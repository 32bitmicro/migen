Migen (Milkymist Generator)
  a Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware

Migen aims at automating further the VLSI design process. It provides
tools to build synchronous designs more productively, integrate
system-on-chips, design dataflow systems, and more. Migen will become
the foundation for the next-generation Milkymist SoC.

See doc/migen.txt for a more complete description.
