Migen (Milkymist Generator)
  a Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware

Migen aims at automating further the VLSI design process. Migen makes it
possible to apply modern software concepts such as object-oriented
programming and metaprogramming to design hardware. This results in more
elegant and easily maintained designs and reduces the incidence of human
errors. Built on these principles, it also provides tools to build
synchronous designs more productively, integrate system-on-chips, design
dataflow systems, and more. Migen will become the foundation for the
next-generation Milkymist SoC.

See the doc/ folder for a more complete description.

Migen is designed for Python 3.2.

Additional permissions under section 7 of the GNU General Public License

non-GPL (including proprietary) logic cores to be used in conjunction
with code generated by Migen in a design.

"Generated" code refers to Verilog or VHDL code that has been obtained
by converting FHDL structures using Migen.

To "instantiate" is to include and connect another module as specified
in section 12.1.2 of the IEEE standard 1364-2001 or in section 9.6 of
the IEEE standard 1076-1993.

(1) You have permission to propagate a work of generated code that
    instantiates modules that are not generated code and do not comply
    with the GPL.
(2) You have permission to propagate a work of Verilog or VHDL code that
    is not generated code, does not comply with the GPL and instantiates
    generated code.

The availability of this exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of Migen.

independently copyrightable, it's yours and I encourage you to claim it
with appropriate copyright notices. This submission then falls under the
"otherwise noted" category. All submissions must use a license
compatible with the GPL and the exception above.
