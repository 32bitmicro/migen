Migen (Milkymist Generator)
  a Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware

Migen aims at automating further the VLSI design process. Migen makes it
possible to apply modern software concepts such as object-oriented
programming and metaprogramming to design hardware. This results in more
elegant and easily maintained designs and reduces the incidence of human
errors. Built on these principles, it also provides tools to build
synchronous designs more productively, integrate system-on-chips, design
dataflow systems, and more. Migen will become the foundation for the
next-generation Milkymist SoC.

See the doc/ folder for a more complete description.
