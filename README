Mibuild (Milkymist Build system)
  a build system and board database for Migen-based FPGA designs

Quick intro:

from migen.fhdl.structure import *
from migen.fhdl.module import Module
from mibuild.platforms import m1
plat = m1.Platform()
led = plat.request("user_led")
m = Module()
counter = Signal(26)
m.comb += led.eq(counter[25])
m.sync += counter.eq(counter + 1)
plat.build_cmdline(m)
